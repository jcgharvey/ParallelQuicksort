Parallel Quicksort
==================

Comparing three parallel implementations
----------------------------------------
Implement a Quicksort algorithm (see Cormen et al., Introduction to Algorithms) that sorts a large array of numbers. Of this relatively simple recursive algorithm you have to implement three versions:
* Using Parallel Task
* Using OpenMP (Pyjama)
* Using threads and standard Java classes.
